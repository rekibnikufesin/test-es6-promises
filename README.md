# Testing ES6 style Promises in Node.js

Writing great ES6 style Promises for Node.js is only half the battle. Your

break them. In this lesson, I show you a simple ES6 Promise in Node.js, then
walk you through creating tests in Mocha using chai and chai-as-promised to
test both resolve and reject methods.
